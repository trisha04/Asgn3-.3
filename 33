Hadoop 2.x has the following components:
a)HDFS:-HDFS stands for hadoop distributed file system.
It is the file system to store large amounts of data in hadoop.
Suitable for processing and also for distributed storage as the name suggests.
It also has built in servers for namenode and datanode.
Secondary name node is present there to provide data availability.
Nmaenode manages file system interface and acts as primary master node.
All the datanodes act as slave nodes and run on low cost commodity nachines

b)YARN:-It stands for Yet Another Resource Negotiator.
The basic concept of Yarn is splitting up functions of resource management and job scheduling 
into separate background threads called daemons.
YARN ensures optimised utilisation of the resources as hadoop works on distributed file systems.
It is characterised as large scale operating system for distributed big data application

c)MAP REDUCE:-It does the processing of the data which is stored in HDFS.
It folows divide and conquer policy also the master slave architechture.
Process of segregation is called Mapper
and process of aggregation is called Reduce
